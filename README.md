# javascript-calculator
In this project, I created a simple (no decimals) javascript calculator. I did this using vanilla javascript, and it was easy.

Some trouble I had:
- Creating the logic for doing 1 part of a calculation first, ex: 12+7-3 ===> would not equal 16
- Currently, the calculation code is confusing, and I can only follow along with paper but it is what I figured out at the time

As a reminder to myself, when working with element.textContent, I have to remember to change from string to integer value.

Other than finding the correct logic for calculating, the project was very simple. And even finding the logic to do the calculation was not too complicated. I enjoyed trying to create my own functional calculator, and I found it to be very interesting and fun. I designed it to the best of my ability to make it look nice. :)
